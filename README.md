(Archive) Win32 Console library for Lua 5.1 &amp; 5.2

I created this library for my own personal use in 2012, and as a chance to practice my skills with the Lua C API. The library is fully-functional, if I remember correctly, and makes use of some older version of my luaW extensions, so it supports UTF-8 on the Lua side and UTF-16 on the Windows side.

As I recall, it was during a time of transition in my own code between XP and Vista, so I think it has support for one of the Console features that was added with Vista but I can't remember how conditional it is.

The contents of the repository are the exact contents of the folder as of the time when I backed-up my important files from my desktop PC in 2013. At that point, I had last touched it in 2012, and I don't think I've made any changes to it since then; the HDD with any possible newer version of the files is inaccessible to me at the moment.
